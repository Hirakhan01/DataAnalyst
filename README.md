Data Analyst Portfolio
======
Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Hira Khan, and I am a data analyst passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. With hands-on experience in tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, MySQL, R, and Excel, I specialize in cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to enable smarter decision-making and drive impactful results.
I have a strong foundation in data preparation, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and storytelling through dashboards and visualizations. My projects highlight my ability to create meaningful, easy-to-understand insights and recommendations for real-world problems.

In this portfolio, you’ll find examples of my work, including interactive dashboards for Zomato, e-commerce, and supermarkets, along with data projects developed using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. These showcase my technical skills in building end-to-end workflows, from extracting raw data to creating compelling dashboards and presentations.
I am continuously exploring new ways to use data to solve problems and tell stories. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see how I can turn data into value!
