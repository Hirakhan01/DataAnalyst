Data Analyst Portfolio
======
Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Hira Khan, and I am a data analyst passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. With hands-on experience in tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, MySQL, R, and Excel, I specialize in cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to enable smarter decision-making and drive impactful results.
I have a strong foundation in data preparation, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and storytelling through dashboards and visualizations. My projects highlight my ability to create meaningful, easy-to-understand insights and recommendations for real-world problems.

In this portfolio, you’ll find examples of my work, including interactive dashboards for Zomato, e-commerce, and supermarkets, along with data projects developed using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. These showcase my technical skills in building end-to-end workflows, from extracting raw data to creating compelling dashboards and presentations.
I am continuously exploring new ways to use data to solve problems and tell stories. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see how I can turn data into value!

## Projects 
### Superstore Sales Dashboard – (Power BI | DAX)
* <span style="color:black">Designed an interactive dashboard for sales insights:</span> Developed a centralized view of key performance metrics, including sales, profit, and customer data, 
  resulting in a 30% reduction in report generation time for stakeholders.
* Identifying a 15% profit increase from top-performing categories: Conducted an in-depth analysis of product categories, showcasing that technology and furniture 
  were responsible for the majority of the profit growth, contributing 60% and 25% of overall sales, respectively.
* Implemented DAX measures for detailed analysis: Used DAX functions such as SUMX and CALCULATE to segment data by region and customer type, identifying that West 
  Region contributed to 40% of total profits, with the highest growth coming from loyal customers, leading to a 20% retention rate increase.
* Profitability insights: Discovered that a 10% discount threshold led to a 5% decrease in profits, guiding management to adjust discount policies for better margins.
